# linuxisobuilder

A command-line tool to simplify the creation of custom Linux ISO images.

## üìú Description

This project provides a simple C++ based interactive tool that guides the user through selecting a distribution, and then provides the necessary commands to build a custom live CD using the distribution's native tools.

## ‚ú® Supported Distributions
* **Debian** (using `live-build`)
* **Ubuntu** (using `live-build`)
* **Fedora** (using `lorax` and Kickstart)
* **Arch Linux** (using `archiso`)

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Support

The official pre-built packages provided in the **Releases** section are automatically built for the following common architectures:

* **Linux:** `x86_64` (amd64), `aarch64` (arm64)
* **Windows:** `x86_64` (x64)
* **macOS:** `x86_64` (Intel), `aarch64` (Apple Silicon)

For all other architectures (such as i386, PowerPC, RISC-V, etc.), you will need to **compile the application from the source** on the target machine.

***

## üì¶ Prerequisites

This tool is designed to be self-sufficient. When you first run it and select a distribution family, it will check for the necessary build tools and prompt you to install them if they are missing.

To compile the tool itself, you will need a C++ compiler (`g++` or `clang++`) and `cmake`.
