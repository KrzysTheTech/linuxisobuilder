# linuxisobuilder

A command-line tool and graphical application to simplify the creation of custom Linux ISO images.

## üìú Description

This project provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through selecting a distribution. It then provides the necessary commands to build a custom live CD using the distribution's native tools.

## ‚ú® Supported Distributions

The tool provides interactive menus and build command generation for the following operating systems:

* **Debian** (via `live-build`)
    * **Versions:** 13 (trixie), 12 (bookworm), 11 (bullseye), unstable (sid), and 10 (buster) `[EOL]`
* **Ubuntu** (via `live-build`)
    * **Versions:** 25.10, 25.04, 24.04 LTS, 22.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS, 18.04 LTS, and 24.10 `[EOL]`

## üì¶ Prerequisites

The tool is designed to be self-sufficient. When you run it and select a distribution family, it will check for the necessary build tools and prompt you to install them if they are missing.

To compile the tool itself, you will need a C++ compiler and `make` or `cmake`.
